## Overview
This project is a collaboration between the [New Orleans Office of the Independent Police Monitor](http://nolaipm.gov) and [Stop Watching NOLA](http://stopwatchingnola.org) to study the effect that crime cameras have had on criminal activity and policing in New Orleans.

## Notes 

- Many cameras from Stop Watching don't have a GPS attached
- Only displaying the school name and not the full description

## Generating data
1. Download stops from data.nola.gov
2. Email stopwatchingnola@gmail.com for camera data
3. Or use files already in `/data`. You can use the `.R` scripts in `/data` to clean data and copy it to `/src/data`

## Deploy
